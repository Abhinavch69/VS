1. In perfect BT, height=h
then total nodes =Math.pow(2,h+1)-1;

2. Number of leaf nodes in perfect BT= 2^h;

3. Number of internal nodes in perfect BT=2^h - 1;

4. n=number of leaves
then number of levesl= log(n+1);

5. n=total number of nodes
min levels in tree = log(n+1)

6. In strict binary tree(node have either 0 or 2 children)

n=leaf nodes
total internal nodes(apart from leaf nodes)= n-1;

7. number of leaf nodes= 1+ number of internal nodes with 2 children(not including root node);
